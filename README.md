# ðŸŒ²ðŸ”¥ Wildfire Infrastructure Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates wildfire spread across a landscape and models the destruction of critical infrastructures like buildings and roads. It uses a grid-based system with probabilistic fire propagation and visualizes the results with Matplotlib.

---

## Features
- 2D grid-based wildfire spread
- Randomized placement of buildings and roads
- Infrastructure destruction upon fire contact
- Visualization of wildfire progression

---

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- (Planned upgrade) Pygame

---

## How It Works
- The land is modeled as a 2D grid.
- Each cell represents ground, building, or road.
- Fire starts at a random location and spreads based on probability.
- Infrastructure cells are destroyed when exposed to fire.
- The simulation animates the progression over time.

## Setup
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muna-Louis-Nwugo/Wildfire-Simulation.git
cd wildfire-infrastructure-simulation
